# final

Shash, Daniel, and I looked at Day 1, 2, and 3 of Advent of Code 2022. 
As Lean was new to all of us, this was a challenging and productive way to learn more about the implementation of the language.
Day 1 concerns sorting and summing. 
Day 2 looks at building and mapping functions.
Day 3 builds on the first 2 and introduces looping.
Our goal was a total of 5 stars for this project.
